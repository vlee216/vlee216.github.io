This is my student website. Testing the commit.

Information about my research and interests goes here.

# Education

I started my time at UW in the Autumn 2024 quarter. Previously, I attended Georgia Tech from 2022 to 2024, earning my professional M.S. in Statistics. My undergraduate education was at New College of Florida from 2018 to 2022, where I received a BA in Statistics with a minor in Museum Studies.

# Additional Interests

In my free time outside of my work as a graduate student, I like to go to Mariners games, practice my bird identification skills, and relax with my rescue cat, Mirabel. I'm also often found walking the grounds of the Woodland Park Zoo.
