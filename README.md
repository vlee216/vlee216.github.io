# Veronica Lee

Hello! I'm Veronica, a second-year Master's student at the University of Washington (UW) in the QERM program. I work in the lab of Dr. Tim Essington, the Marine Conservation and Ecology Group. My current work focuses on differing tolerances for hypoxia across marine species according to taxonomic groupings and connecting in-situ observations with laboratory experiments on hypoxia. More generally, I am interested in using habitat suitability modeling techniques to support conservation planning and predict potential responses to changing ocean conditions. I am also interested in techniques for working with low-quality data, citizen science data, and data from differing sources.

# Education

I started my time at UW in the Autumn 2024 quarter. Previously, I attended Georgia Tech from 2022 to 2024, earning my professional M.S. in Statistics. My undergraduate education was at New College of Florida from 2018 to 2022, where I received a BA in Statistics with a minor in Museum Studies.

# Additional Interests

In my free time outside of my work as a graduate student, I like to go to Mariners games or relax at home with my rescue cat, Mirabel. I'm also often found walking the grounds of the Woodland Park Zoo. I am an amateur birder, and my favorite birds that I've seen in the wild are the magnificent frigatebird, American bittern, and crested caracara.
